It is a simple algorithm you can use for 2v2 and 3v3 matches.

# How does it work?

This algorithm creates the most competitive matches after scanning the players' information.

Note1: Please contact me if you have a better idea to scan the different team possibilities that may arise.

Note2: This is first public code I uploaded to github. If you like the team algorithm, don't forget to add a star.
