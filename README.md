# Ideal Team Algorithm

It is a simple algorithm you can use for 2v2 and 3v3 matches.

# How does it work?

It chooses the most competitive of all team possibilities:

First we get the information of all the players. Then we find the match with the least difference between the two teams out of all team possibilities.

Note: Please contact me if you have a better idea to scan the different team possibilities that may arise.
